Question 
A small startup office has the following requirement
Every branch office deals with similar n items and the quantities of these different items
are to be communicated to head office every day. The Head office calculates the current cost 
of these by multiplying the individual by corresponding rates. The total cost is communicated 
back to the respective branches for paying advance tax. You ( as a software developer) have 
convinced the corporate that parallel implementation (MPI) will be more time effective/efficient. 
The corporate wishes to have the communication secure and asks for evidence of effectiveness. 


Approach: 

Here every branch deals with n items and the rates of the processes are already been given in 
code. 

Rates are gives as 10,20,30,40 and the value of n items is 1 for each. Here we took n=4 items to 
simplify the processes division according to number of processor input.

Then the cost of processes is calculated and the advance tax is added as percentage of the total cost.

Here because of parallel implementation the calculation is much faster and effective against 
larger test cases.
