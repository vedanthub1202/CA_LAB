# Assignment: CA4 -> Image Histogram

PROBLEM STATEMENT: In the Assignment we have to implement distributed
image Histogram with MPI and analyse.

Firstly the grayscale plane image we put in image.
Then the program displayed the dully formed grayscale image. 
The aspect ratio of the grayscale image is 667 * 1000.
The total number of pixels in grayscale image are 667000.

Then the program displayed the histogram of normal grayscale image.
The x-axis denotes Pixel intensity and Y-axis denotes 
Number of Pixels belong to the Pixel Intensity.
The maximum number went up to 25000 pixels in between 150 to 200 pixels.

Then the enhanced grayscale image is shown and the histogarm related to the image.
Here the x-axis denotes Pixels Intensities and counts in enhaced Image. 
and Y-axis denotes Number of Pixels Belonging to Pixel Intensity.
The Maximum number of pixels intensity went upto 25000 pixels between the range 
of 200 to 250 pixels.
